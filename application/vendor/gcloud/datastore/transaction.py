class Transaction(object):
    """An abstraction representing datastore Transactions.

    Transactions can be used
    to build up a bulk mutuation
    as well as provide isolation.

    For example,
    the following snippet of code
    will put the two ``save`` operations
    (either ``insert_auto_id`` or ``upsert``)
    into the same mutation, and execute those within a transaction::

      >>> from gcloud import datastore
      >>> dataset = datastore.get_dataset('dataset-id', email, key_path)
      >>> with dataset.transaction(bulk_mutation=True)  # The default.
      ...   entity1.save()
      ...   entity2.save()

    By default, the transaction is rolled back if the transaction block
    exits with an error::

      >>> from gcloud import datastore
      >>> dataset = datastore.get_dataset('dataset-id', email, key_path)
      >>> with dataset.transaction() as t:
      ...   do_some_work()
      ...   raise Exception() # rolls back

    If the transaction block exists without an exception,
    it will commit by default.

    .. warning::
      Inside a transaction,
      automatically assigned IDs for entities
      will not be available at save time!
      That means,
      if you try::

        >>> with dataset.transaction():
        ...   entity = dataset.entity('Thing').save()

      ``entity`` won't have a complete Key
      until the transaction is committed.

      Once you exit the transaction (or call ``commit()``),
      the automatically generated ID will be assigned
      to the entity::

        >>> with dataset.transaction():
        ...   entity = dataset.entity('Thing')
        ...   entity.save()
        ...   assert entity.key().is_partial()  # There is no ID on this key.
        >>> assert not entity.key().is_partial()  # There *is* an ID.

    .. warning::
      If you're using the automatically generated ID functionality,
      it's important that you only use
      :func:`gcloud.datastore.entity.Entity.save`
      rather than using
      :func:`gcloud.datastore.connection.Connection.save_entity` directly.

      If you mix the two,
      the results will have extra IDs generated
      and it could jumble things up.

    If you don't want to use the context manager
    you can initialize a transaction manually::

      >>> transaction = dataset.transaction()
      >>> transaction.begin()

      >>> entity = dataset.entity('Thing')
      >>> entity.save()

      >>> if error:
      ...   transaction.rollback()
      ... else:
      ...   transaction.commit()

    For now,
    this library will enforce a rule of
    one transaction per connection.
    That is,
    If you want to work with two transactions at the same time
    (for whatever reason),
    that must happen over two separate
    :class:`gcloud.datastore.connection.Connection` s.

    For example, this is perfectly valid::

      >>> from gcloud import datastore
      >>> dataset = datastore.get_dataset('dataset-id', email, key_path)
      >>> with dataset.transaction():
      ...   dataset.entity('Thing').save()

    However, this **wouldn't** be acceptable::

      >>> from gcloud import datastore
      >>> dataset = datastore.get_dataset('dataset-id', email, key_path)
      >>> with dataset.transaction():
      ...   dataset.entity('Thing').save()
      ...   with dataset.transaction():
      ...     dataset.entity('Thing').save()

    Technically, it looks like the Protobuf API supports this type of pattern,
    however it makes the code particularly messy.
    If you really need to nest transactions, try::

      >>> from gcloud import datastore
      >>> dataset1 = datastore.get_dataset('dataset-id', email, key_path)
      >>> dataset2 = datastore.get_dataset('dataset-id', email, key_path)
      >>> with dataset1.transaction():
      ...   dataset1.entity('Thing').save()
      ...   with dataset2.transaction():
      ...     dataset2.entity('Thing').save()
